Crop Suggestion App
Description
The Crop Suggestion App is designed to help farmers make informed decisions based on soil moisture, temperature, 
and NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) values. By analyzing these parameters, the app provides crop recommendations 
tailored to the user's local conditions. This offline-capable app empowers farmers to optimize their crop yield and resource 
management without needing constant internet access. 

Technologies Used
This app was constructed using XML for the front-end design, enabling a responsive 
and user-friendly interface. The back-end logic is implemented in Java, which processes 
user inputs and provides accurate crop suggestions based on real-time data. The combination of these technologies ensures a 
seamless experience for users.

How to Install
To install the app, download the app-debug.apk file from this repository. Ensure your device allows
installations from unknown sources by enabling this option in the settings. Once downloaded, locate the APK file in your deviceâ€™s 
file manager, tap on it, and follow the on-screen instructions to install. After installation, you can use the app offline to receive 
crop suggestions based on your soil data.
